Building the Leading Financial Profit for Bitcoin

As of today (July 2024), Bitcoin's market value is approximately $1 trillion, accounting for 50% of the market share. In a situation where the price increase has narrowed to only 10-20% in each cycle (4 years), how to activate Bitcoin's trillion-dollar market value and use Bitcoin for value creation or increase Bitcoin profits has become a very attractive business opportunity.

Now, this opportunity has emerged. The Bitcoin ecosystem has experienced a massive explosion in the past year, first with inscriptions, then with the battle of Bitcoin Layer 2s, and Babylon's native Bitcoin staking, which has completely opened up various demands for Bitcoin. Funds from all directions have flocked to the Bitcoin community, and various Bitcoin-based interest-bearing assets are rapidly growing.

Generally speaking, there are two types of businesses in the Bitcoin ecosystem:

The first focuses on Bitcoin's monetary attributes, such as Lightning Network's flash payments, or Babylon's native Bitcoin staking or other projects' Bitcoin staking, mainly utilizing Bitcoin's intrinsic value to generate money from money.

The second focuses on the Bitcoin network, such as inscriptions and various Bitcoin L2s, treating the Bitcoin network as a data proof layer or ownership ledger, attempting to expand the capabilities of the Bitcoin network.

BifiPal is willing to be a pioneer in developing Bitcoin finance, leveraging Bitcoin's monetary attributes to explore decentralized financial businesses and application scenarios, building a Bitcoin-centered financial system. With the launch of various global BTC ETFs and the entry of various capital into the crypto world, it aims to create a new era of finance that integrates real-world finance with crypto finance.
