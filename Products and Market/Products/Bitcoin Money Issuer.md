# Bitcoin Money Issuer

Providing the most secure Bitcoin asset issuance model and tools for Bitcoin holders. Users lock Bitcoin through 2-2 dual signatures with Bitcoin native smart contracts or time lock + user single signature to issue a Bitcoin-based world currency: Bollar. The ownership of Bollar belongs to Bitcoin holders, and the income (interest) generated by Bollar belongs to the minters. The yield assets (Yield Token) can be traded and liquidated through the interest swap market, attracting idle Bitcoin in wallets to provide more liquidity to the market. If it reaches half or even more of Bitcoin's market value, that would be $500 billion.

Based on Bitcoin's monetary attributes as digital gold, BifiPal is also exploring the possibility of Bitcoin as M0 in crypto finance. If it can stimulate M1 and M2 in the crypto world, the scale of assets and liquidity could potentially be 10 or 100 times that of Bitcoin itself. We look forward to working with various parties in the Bitcoin ecosystem to co-build the grand blueprint of Bitcoin finance.
