Combining Security and Flexibility

Security is ensured as BifiPal supports Bitcoin native standards, allowing users to engage in low-yield staking and wealth management while their BTC remains on the Bitcoin network and users maintain full control over Bitcoin ownership, with security equivalent to the Bitcoin network.

Flexibility is achieved through a custodial model for high-yield BTC staking and wealth management, and assets can be liquidated through the liquidity provided by the interest swap market, greatly satisfying different user needs.
