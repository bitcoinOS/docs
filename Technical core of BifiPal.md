# Technical core of BifiPal
Solutions: Create a Bitcoin Native Smart Contract & Finance Layer

BifiPal's original intention is to be profit-driven, with the vision of creating a full suite of financial services on Bitcoin. This includes, but is not limited to, decentralized Bitcoin banks, Bitcoin smart wallets, Bitcoin credit and derivatives, constructing a Bitcoin native financial layer such as Bitcoin staking/restaking, RWAs, Insurances, etc. Supplemented by a yield market similar to the Pendle protocol, it will accommodate all interest-bearing assets in the Bitcoin ecosystem, providing one-stop financial services to meet various types of participants, whether you are a Bitcoin holder, a conservative investor, a financial product enthusiast, or a trader pursuing returns.

Technically, BifiPal follows various Bitcoin technical standards (BIPs), mainly using technology stacks such as rust-bitcoin, miniscript, bdk, RGB, etc., to build Bitcoin native smart contracts and account abstraction, providing currency-level functionality and security services for Bitcoin.

At the same time, BifiPal runs on ICP, currently the best crypto network. BifiPal utilizes ICP's AWS-like infrastructure capabilities to provide application-level flexibility and scalability for Bitcoin financial services.

ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) is a cryptographic consensus protocol, with its core including P2P network layer, consensus layer, message routing layer, and execution layer. The network applying the ICP protocol is called the Internet Computer, which is a blockchain cloud network. ICP is a Layer 0 level infrastructure on which various blockchains can be built.

ICP relies on powerful cryptographic technologies such as Chain-Key Cryptography and Threshold Cryptography. There are multiple subnets on the network, and the interoperability between these subnets and between ICP and the external internet is excellent. Through cryptographically built-in on-chain oracles, ICP has implemented a complete Bitcoin full node on Canister containers.

In short, ICP is an excellent choice for building modular blocks, with a powerful execution layer and data availability layer (DA), better privacy, and can be used as a general functional version of on-chain Lightning Network. For details, please refer to the ICP official website
